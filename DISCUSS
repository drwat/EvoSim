Also toying with some module-specific enhancements - non-biological
(Supernatural/Immaterial, Digital/Silicon ["Siliceous"]) lifeforms as a class of
 Non-Cellular life (currently Viral is the only class of Non-Cellular life).

I'm attempting to design the engine so as not to be limited in scope to existent
biology in terms of genetic and cellular structure and mechanics and thus
realizable upper-hierarchy taxa, i.e. so as not to limit the possible forms of
life to those of the Three Domain System (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya) nor the
Six-Kingdom System (Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Protista, Fungi, Plantae,
Animalia) nor the Two-Empire System (Prokaryota/Monera and Eukaryota).

I think it's important to set  objectives early on and think about what we want 
the end result to be.

If all the focus of this project is set on the coding, and we don't have a big
picture, it will be very easy to lose focus and direction.

I have built a game concept and dynamics concept, based on some things i talked
with wlw. It's in it's very first stage, so give the idea room to breathe 
before bashing it. That being said, i have no problem with my concept being 
rejected completely or heavily modified. I'm just chipping in something i came
up with that might be interesting.

My idea is reaching a niche. A niche that needs attention and love. In 
evolution sim games such as sim earth, sim life and spore there have been 
horrible simplifications and terrible mechanisms of interaction.
The niche i'm trying to reach is people that appreciate complex systems
and watching them work, such as evolutionary paths and ecosystems.

Anyway, here's the concept:

This is a bird eye's view simulation game, very similar to sim-life/sim-earth,
with some aspects of black and white. The key difference is the amount of 
environmental and intercreature interactions that create a rich ecosystem. 
The key aspect of the game is getting players to tweak and play with a very 
complex ecosystem that reacts to disturbances and change in a logical, natural 
way.

In creative mode there are no goals. it's just a simulation that keeps running
and running. You can introduce new creatures whenever you like, kill individual 
creatures whenever you like, alter the terrain, or alter the resources 
available.

You are god. Creatures with certain amount of intelligence might worship, love 
and/or fear you or even try to communicate with you.

In survival mode you assume the role of a particular species in an ecosystem. 
Your goal is that you or your direct descendants achieve biomass goals 
(i.e.: total biomass=1kg, 10kg, 100kg, etc.).

You have limited resources you can make available and limited interventions on 
other creatures and the environment you can make. When achieving any biomass 
goal, you gain more power to alter creatures' genomes/the environment/resources

Other types of gameplay might be introduced to the engine later on.

Rules/Dynamic:

-An environment map with random resources, terrain, and climate is created.
-A few random creatures with certain uses for resources, terrain preference, 
climate preference and excretion of different resources are created.
-Predators are introduced.
-higher predators are introduced.
-simbiotes are introduced
-parasites are introduced

You design creatures/a creature and 'set them free' in the environment.

Your creature interacts with the resources, processing them and turning them 
into excretions, and interacts with other creatures either ignoring them, 
fighting them or collaborating. One possible result is using another animal as 
a resouce for a prolonged period of time(parasitic behavior), another would be 
killing it and using a lump sum of the animal as resources, or working together 
with another animal to gather resources more effectively.

Your creature may move and reach new areas.

Your creature may not be able to move, and may reach new areas via reproduction
or growth.

Your creature's genetic traits present mutations with time. amount of time 
required for change depends on the lifespan(function of size, speed, etc) of 
your creature. Probability of mutation for a trait that's closer to its hard 
upper or lower limit gets exponentially lower. Normal distribution, etc.

Your creatures may fork and take different evolutionary paths.

The amount of genetic traits that exist are hundreds, if not thousands. They 
interact with eachother. Some traits are necessary to gain others. Some are 
mutually exclusive. Some genetic traits are functions of other gentic traits.

Example:

macro-traits:
   Max size: 1 pixel - 800x800 pixels
   size at birth:
   max strength:
   min resource 1 consumption required:
   min resource 2 consumption required:
   (...)
   excretion type 1: 
   excretion type 2:
   excretion type 3:
   (...)
   max temp:
   min temp:
   resource 1 excreted when dead: i.e. meat type 2
   resource 2 excreted when dead: i.e. skin.
   
sexual traits:
   Type of reproduction: sexual-asexual
   max distance between mates required for mating:
   avg amount of spawns per litter:
   Std dev of spawns per litter:
   Time between litters:
   internal incubation period:
   external incubation period:
   etc.
   
Irritability traits:
   eyesight resolution: 0-1000km
   field of view x axis: 0-360
   smell effectivity distance: 0-100000 km.
   electromagnetic perception: 0-100%
   heat detection: 0-100%
   
physical traits:
   max speed as function of terrain, temperature, age, size, limbs and health: 
   (bodylengths per second)
   avg speed as function of terrain, temperature, age and health:
   % of body covered by exoskeleton: 0-100%
   % of body with endoskeleton: 0-100%
   size.

Camouflage traits
   (...)
   
Mental traits
 (...)
 
You get the idea. I expect feedback, be it positive or negative.
