Mulling over some game ideas. Greek mythology - play as Greek deities, e.g.
Gaia, Pan, et al, controlling the direction and course of Life. Actions
influence the players's abilities via some kind of experience/acheivement
system, as in an RPG, as well as the player's character as in Fable and others.
Gameplay would resemble in many ways that of Black & White, Sim Life, Sim Earth
and other artificial life games. Needs work, we're not trying to clone an
existing game.

Also toying with some module-specific enhancements - non-biological
(Supernatural/Immaterial, Digital/Silicon ["Siliceous"]) lifeforms as a class of
 Non-Cellular life (currently Viral is the only class of Non-Cellular life).

I'm attempting to design the engine so as not to be limited in scope to existent
biology in terms of genetic and cellular structure and mechanics and thus
realizable upper-hierarchy taxa, i.e. so as not to limit the possible forms of
life to those of the Three Domain System (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya) nor the
Six-Kingdom System (Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Protista, Fungi, Plantae,
Animalia) nor the Two-Empire System (Prokaryota/Monera and Eukaryota).
