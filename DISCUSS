Also toying with some module-specific enhancements - non-biological
(Supernatural/Immaterial, Digital/Silicon ["Siliceous"]) lifeforms as a class of
 Non-Cellular life (currently Viral is the only class of Non-Cellular life).

I'm attempting to design the engine so as not to be limited in scope to existent
biology in terms of genetic and cellular structure and mechanics and thus
realizable upper-hierarchy taxa, i.e. so as not to limit the possible forms of
life to those of the Three Domain System (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya) nor the
Six-Kingdom System (Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Protista, Fungi, Plantae,
Animalia) nor the Two-Empire System (Prokaryota/Monera and Eukaryota).
